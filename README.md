## Language: Verilog

This repository contains homework assignments based on the course "Hardware Description Language Design" at NCHU.

### Overview

- **ALU:** Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, finding maximum and minimum values, and logical operations including AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR.
  
- **FF:** Flip-Flops, including DFF (Data Flip-Flop), TFF (Toggle Flip-Flop), and an enable signal for control.
  
- **Comparator:** Features a 4-bit Comparator and a combined 16-bit Comparator, providing three output results: greater than, less than, and equal to.
  
- **Counter:** Configurable to count upwards, downwards, in hexadecimal, or in decimal.
  
- **Vending Machine:** Implemented using a Finite State Machine (FSM), supports inputs of 10 and 50 units of currency, four products, four price points, change return, and product dispensing.
  
- **Debouncing:** Debouncing for transitions from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0, implemented using an FSM.
  
- **RAM4096X16:** Composed of 1024x8 RAMs, forming a single port RAM. In write mode, output data is in high-impedance state.
  
- **Stack:** Standard stack implementation with PUSH, POP, and CLEAR control signals.

Each folder contains Verilog code and spec.png, which visually describes the project's specifications or circuit diagram.
