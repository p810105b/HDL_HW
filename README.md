# HDL_HW

## Language: Verilog

This repository contains homework assignments based on the course "Hardware Description Language Design" at NCHU.

### Overview

- **ALU:** Arithmetic Logic Unit, fundamental building block of the CPU, performing arithmetic and logic operations.
- **FF:** Flip-Flops, basic storage elements in digital circuits, used for storing binary data.
- **Comparator:** Digital circuit that performs comparison between two binary numbers, outputs a signal based on the comparison.
- **Counter:** Digital circuit that counts the number of occurrences of an event, often used in timing applications.
- **Vending Machine:** Simulation of a vending machine's logic control, handling input selection, payment, and change dispensing.
- **Debouncing:** Circuit to eliminate noise or unstable states in switch inputs, ensuring clean transition signals.
- **RAM4096X16:** Implementation of a small RAM block with a size of 4096 x 16 bits, demonstrating memory design.
- **Stack:** Data structure implementation in Verilog, showcasing push/pop operations and stack management.

Each folder contains Verilog code and spec.png, which visually describes the project's specifications or circuit diagram.
